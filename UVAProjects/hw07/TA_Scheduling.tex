\section{Book 7.28: TA Scheduling}

%%%%%%% Mathematical Formulation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
\textbf{(a)} Given an input of $T$ TA's, $S$ sessions, and parameters a, b, and c where the number of sessions each TA
can hold a week is $t_i$, $a \leq t_i \leq b, \forall i \in 1..T$ and the total number of seesions that can
be held a week must be $\leq c$. Determine which TAs cover which sessions if all requirements are met. \\

\noindent \textbf{(b)} Given the above information, add in a density $d_i$ representing the minimum number of sessions that must be
held that day of the week. Again determine which TAs cover which sessions if all requirements are met.

%%%%%%% Algorithm %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Solution}
\indent In both cases we will begin by determining if the number of TA's $T$ can acceed the minimum capacity
$c$ by checking $c \geq T\cdot a$. We then construct a circulation digraph max flow 
representation with $2 + T + S + 2$ nodes: 1 source, 1 virtual source, $T$ TA, $S$ session, 1 virtual 
sink, and 1 sink node. To ensure that the minimum capacity for each TA is met, we connect the source to each
TA node with capacity $a$, then, to account for this we will connect the source to the virtual source
with with a capacity $c-T\cdot a$ and the virtual source will connect to each of the TA nodes with a
capacity of $b-a$ so that the total sum of in-capacities for each TA node is $a + b - a = b$. Therefore
our total out-degree from the source node will be $T\cdot a + (c - T\cdot a) = c$. Now, according to 
availablility of the TA's, we connect them to the corresponding session nodes with a capacity of 1. This 
is the same build for both parts (a) and (b). \\  

\indent For part \textbf{(a)}, we will assign edges from each of the sesssion nodes to
the virtual sink with capacity 1 to represent that each session can only have 1 TA. Then to ensure that
the cycle is complete and that the maximum number of sessions is $\leq c$, we connect the virtual sink
with a capacity of $c$ to the sink. \\

\indent For part \textbf{(b)}, we will add in 7 extra nodes, each representing a day with a correspoding
value of $d_i, i \in 1..7$. We continue our connections by connecting each seesion, to their correspoding
day with a capacity of 1 to represent that each session can only have 1 TA. The for each day, $i$, we connect
it directly to the sink with a capacity of $d_i$ to represent the minimum density that must be met. Next, we 
connect it to the virtual sink with a capacity of $\infty$ since they have met the minimum requitrement of $d_i$.
Now we just connect the virtual sink to the sink with a capacity of $c - \sum_{i = 1}^7 d_i$ such that the
total in-capacity of the sink is  $\sum_{i = 1}^7 d_i + c - \sum_{i = 1}^{7} d_i = c$. \\

\indent Now that we are fully connected we run Ford Fulkerson and if the max flow is $\textless T\cdot a$ then we have
not fufilled the required minimum flow. Otherwise we go through each TA node and check its edges, if the 
edge has a flow value, then print the TA and the Session information.  \\

\noindent For Purposes of simplicity we will show the algorithm for \textbf{(b)} as it is part (a) with an additional constaint.

\subsection{Correctness}
%%%%%%% PROPOSITION 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
~ \\ \indent This algorithm will determine (if one exists) a valid schedule for office hours,
specifying which TA will cover which time slots. If one does not exist, then it will report so.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
~ \\ \indent We do this by construction. 
\end{proof}


%%%%%%% Analysis %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Analysis}
For this section we will use the following variables: $T$ for number of TAs, S for number of
sessions, C for number of connections between TAs and Sessions, $V = T + S + 7 + 4$ for total
number of nodes and $E = 2\cdot T + C + 2\cdot S$ for total number of edges. We say then that
we can make our calculations based off V + E.

%%%%%%% PROPOSITION 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
\label{numq}
The \underline{space complexity} of this algorithm is \textbf{O(V+E)}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
~ \\ \indent This is due to the fact that we only store the nodes and the connections between
them in a datastructure and the rest is stored in constant variables.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%% PROPOSITION 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
\label{numq}
The \underline{time complexity} of this algorithm is \textbf{O(T$\cdot$S + MaxFlowValue$\cdot$E + C)}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
~ \\ \indent We can break this down into the loops which we have described in our algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item TA Node Connection: we go through each TA node (T) and connect it to the source and
        virtual source (2) and then go through every session and see if it is a valid time
        for each TA to work (S) $\implies T\cdot (2+S) \implies O(T\cdot S)$
    \item Session Node: we have already connected each session to its corresponding TAs, now
        we just connect each one (S) to the specific day that it belongs to (1) $\implies O(S)$
    \item Days: when we have to connect each day to the sink and virtual sink $(7\cdot 2)$ which
        is considered arbitrary in the large cases $\implies O(1)$
    \item MAX FLOW: Known to be $O(MaxFlowValue\cdot E)$
    \item Check TAs and days: we check that each TA and day have met the minimum requirements
        $\implies O(T)$
    \item Print out: Go through every edge going from TA to Session nodes $\implies O(C)$
\end{enumerate}
Thus summing to be $T\cdot S + S + 1 + MaxFlowValue\cdot E + T + C$ which in Big-O becomes
\textbf{O(T$\cdot$S + MaxFlowValue$\cdot$E + C)}
\end{proof}
